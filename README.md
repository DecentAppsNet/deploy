# DecentAppsNet/deploy Github Action

This action is used to deploy to the Decent Portal at https://decentapps.net. For it to be meaningful or useful to you, you'd need a lot more context!

A better starting point might be the [Create Decent App](https://decentapps.net/info/create-decent-app-quick-start.html) project generator tool.

# Support, Bugs, Security

This is basically a downstream project to other open source projects, and issue tracking/support will be handled in those projects.

TODO--copy text over from other places that is better.
